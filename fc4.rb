    # brew audit doesn’t like this; it prints:
    #   Non-executables were installed to "/usr/local/opt/fc4/bin"
    # ...it wants jar files installed to libexec, which we should be able to do but first we’ll need
    # to update the script `fc4` which lives in the fc4-framework repo; right now it expects the jar
    # file to be in the same dir as the script; we’ll need to change it to maybe look in a few
    # different places? I’m not sure; I want to continue to support the manual install case for
    # those who cannot or prefer not to use Homebrew.

  def caveats
    <<~CAVEAT
      In addition to the declared dependency on Java, this formula also requires Chromium or Chrome.
      If needed, you may be able to install Chromium via `brew cask install chromium`
